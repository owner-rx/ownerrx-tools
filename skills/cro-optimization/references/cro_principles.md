# CRO Principles Reference

13 non-negotiable principles for high-converting landing pages. Each principle includes detection criteria and fix patterns.

---

## 1. Clarity Beats Persuasion

If visitors do not instantly understand what the page is about, nothing else matters.

### Requirements
Above the fold must answer in under 5 seconds:
- What is this?
- Who is it for?
- Why should I care?

### Detection Criteria
- Headline uses jargon or insider language
- Value proposition requires reading subheadline to understand
- Multiple competing messages above the fold
- Clever wordplay prioritized over clarity

### Fix Pattern
```
BEFORE: "Revolutionize your workflow with AI-powered synergy"
AFTER: "Schedule meetings in 30 seconds. No back-and-forth emails."
```

**Rule:** One primary action per page. No clever language before clarity.

---

## 2. Single Core Desire Per Page

High-converting pages sell one outcome, not many features.

### Requirements
- One primary emotional payoff
- Secondary benefits only support the core desire
- Feature lists must connect to outcomes

### Detection Criteria
- Multiple equal-weight value propositions
- Feature dump without outcome framing
- "And also..." pattern in copy
- More than 3 benefits above the fold

### Fix Pattern
```
BEFORE: "Project management, time tracking, invoicing, team chat, and file storage"
AFTER: "Ship projects 2x faster. Everything else is built around that."
```

**Rule:** Identify the single strongest desire and anchor all copy to it.

---

## 3. Message Match Everywhere

The page must feel like the inevitable continuation of the click that brought the user there.

### Requirements
- Headline mirrors ad, email, or link promise
- No new positioning introduced mid-page
- Consistent vocabulary and framing throughout

### Detection Criteria
- Headline differs significantly from traffic source promise
- New benefits introduced that weren't in the ad
- Tone shift between source and landing page
- Different product framing mid-page

### Fix Pattern
```
AD: "Get 10 qualified leads per day"
LANDING PAGE HEADLINE: "10 Qualified Leads Per Day, Guaranteed"

NOT: "The Ultimate Sales Solution for Modern Teams"
```

**Rule:** If traffic source is known, enforce exact message match between source and headline.

---

## 4. Objection Handling, Not Hype

CRO removes friction. It does not add excitement.

### Top 5 Universal Objections
1. Does this work for someone like me?
2. Is this worth the money?
3. How hard is it to use?
4. What happens if it fails?
5. Can I trust this company?

### Requirements
- List objections before writing copy
- Answer objections proactively, not defensively
- Place social proof next to the objection it resolves

### Detection Criteria
- No testimonials addressing specific concerns
- FAQ section missing or generic
- Guarantees/refunds buried in footer
- No "who this is for" section

### Fix Pattern
```
OBJECTION: "Is this worth the money?"
PLACEMENT: ROI calculator or savings estimate near pricing
PROOF: Testimonial with specific financial outcome

OBJECTION: "Does this work for my situation?"
PLACEMENT: "Perfect for..." section with specific use cases
PROOF: Testimonial from similar customer type
```

**Rule:** Surface and neutralize objections in copy. Never hide them.

---

## 5. Visual Hierarchy Drives Behavior

Users scan. Structure decides conversion.

### Requirements
- One dominant visual focal point above the fold
- Clear hierarchy: Headline > Subheadline > CTA
- White space as a conversion tool
- Eye flow guides toward CTA

### Detection Criteria
- Multiple elements competing for attention
- CTA button same visual weight as other elements
- Cluttered above-the-fold area
- No clear reading path

### Fix Pattern
```
HIERARCHY CHECK:
1. What does the eye hit first? (Should be headline or key visual)
2. Where does it go second? (Should be value prop or subheadline)
3. Where does it go third? (Should be CTA)

If any step leads to a non-converting element, restructure.
```

**Rule:** Flag layouts where multiple elements compete for attention.

---

## 6. Cognitive Load Minimization

Every extra decision reduces conversion.

### Requirements
- Minimum viable form fields
- Short sentences, simple language
- Progressive disclosure for complex information
- One choice at a time

### Detection Criteria
- Form asks for unnecessary information
- Sentences average over 20 words
- Technical jargon without explanation
- Multiple CTAs with equal prominence

### Fix Pattern
```
FORM REDUCTION:
BEFORE: Name, Email, Phone, Company, Role, Team Size, Budget, Timeline
AFTER: Email (everything else can be asked later)

PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE:
BEFORE: 2000-word feature explanation
AFTER: "See how it works" expandable section
```

**Rule:** Remove anything that requires thinking unless it directly increases confidence.

---

## 7. Trust Before CTA

You do not earn clicks. You earn confidence.

### Requirements
- Trust signals appear before first CTA
- Specific proof, not vague claims
- Logos, numbers, testimonials, guarantees strategically placed

### Detection Criteria
- CTA appears before any social proof
- Vague trust language ("trusted by many")
- No third-party validation (G2, Capterra, awards)
- Testimonials without names, photos, or specifics

### Fix Pattern
```
BEFORE: "Trusted by many companies"
AFTER: "Used by 12,347 teams across 42 countries"

BEFORE: [CTA Button]
AFTER: "Join 50,000+ marketers" + [CTA Button] + "No credit card required"
```

**Rule:** No CTA without trust reinforcement immediately before or after it.

---

## 8. Behavioral Triggers That Work

Psychology applied responsibly. No gimmicks.

### Effective Triggers
| Trigger | Why It Works | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Loss aversion | Losses hurt 2x more than gains feel good | "Stop losing 3 hours/day to email" |
| Specificity | Specific = believable | "Save 3.4 hours per week" not "Save time" |
| Social proof | We follow others' behavior | "47,293 teams switched this month" |
| Scarcity (real) | Limited = valuable | "12 spots left in March cohort" |

### Detection Criteria
- Generic benefit language ("save time", "grow faster")
- Gain framing when loss framing would be stronger
- Fake scarcity or urgency
- Round numbers instead of specific ones

### Fix Pattern
```
GAIN FRAMING: "Get more done"
LOSS FRAMING: "Stop wasting 2 hours every day on tasks AI can do"

GENERIC: "Increase productivity"
SPECIFIC: "Teams using [Product] complete sprints 37% faster"
```

**Rule:** Prefer concrete, loss-framed, and specific language.

---

## 9. Friction Audit Framework

Every section must justify its existence.

### Section Justification Test
Ask of each section:
1. Does this reduce doubt?
2. Does this increase desire?
3. Does this guide action?

**If none apply, remove it.**

### Detection Criteria
- Sections that don't serve conversion goal
- Redundant information across sections
- "Nice to have" content that adds length
- Company history/mission before value proposition

### Fix Pattern
```
AUDIT EACH SECTION:
[Hero] → Increases desire ✓
[Features] → Reduces doubt ✓
[Team Bios] → Does this reduce doubt for THIS product? Often ✗
[Blog Preview] → Guides action to conversion? Usually ✗

REMOVE: Team bios, blog previews, company history (unless they directly address objections)
```

**Rule:** Perform section-by-section friction audit. Remove non-converting elements.

---

## 10. CTA Discipline

CTAs fail because they ask too much, too soon.

### CTA Commitment Ladder
| User Awareness | CTA Type | Example |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| Unaware | Educational | "See how it works" |
| Problem-aware | Value-focused | "Get the free playbook" |
| Solution-aware | Trial-focused | "Start free trial" |
| Product-aware | Purchase-focused | "Get started for $29/mo" |

### Detection Criteria
- High-commitment CTA for cold traffic
- "Sign Up" or "Submit" as CTA copy
- CTA repeated without new information between
- Multiple CTAs with different asks competing

### Fix Pattern
```
BEFORE: "Sign Up" (vague, high commitment)
AFTER: "Start your free trial" (clear, lower commitment)

BEFORE: "Submit" (generic, friction-inducing)
AFTER: "Get my free report" (benefit-focused, specific)

CTA PLACEMENT RULE:
Repeat CTA only AFTER adding new trust/value information
```

**Rule:** Match CTA commitment level to user awareness stage.

---

## 11. Scannability Is Mandatory

If it cannot be skimmed, it will not be read.

### Requirements
- Short paragraphs (3 lines max)
- Bullet points over prose for features/benefits
- Section headers tell a story when read alone
- Bold key phrases for scanning

### Detection Criteria
- Paragraphs over 4 lines
- No subheadings for 300+ words
- Headers that don't communicate value when read alone
- Wall of text anywhere on page

### Fix Pattern
```
BEFORE: "Our platform provides comprehensive solutions for managing
your entire workflow including task management, time tracking, team
collaboration, file sharing, and reporting capabilities that help
teams of all sizes work more efficiently."

AFTER:
**Everything your team needs:**
- Task management that actually gets used
- Time tracking without the spreadsheets
- Collaboration that doesn't require another meeting
```

**Rule:** Optimize for skimming first, deep reading second.

---

## 12. Conversion Momentum

Each section should make the next action feel easier.

### Momentum Building Pattern
1. Start with low-risk agreement (acknowledge their problem)
2. Build confidence gradually (proof, then more proof)
3. End with urgency that feels earned (after value is established)

### Detection Criteria
- Page starts with hard sell
- Urgency appears before value is established
- No confidence-building between sections
- Abrupt transition to CTA

### Fix Pattern
```
MOMENTUM SEQUENCE:
1. "Tired of [problem]?" (Agreement - low risk)
2. "Here's why it happens" (Education - builds trust)
3. "Here's the fix" (Solution - increases desire)
4. "Here's proof it works" (Testimonials - reduces doubt)
5. "Here's what you get" (Offer - clarifies value)
6. "Join 10,000+ who fixed this" (CTA - feels earned)
```

**Rule:** Each section should logically prepare the user for the next step.

---

## 13. Data Over Opinions

CRO is empirical, not aesthetic.

### Requirements
- Recommendations should be testable
- Avoid absolute claims
- Provide hypotheses, not certainties
- Track and measure impact

### Framing Pattern
```
ABSOLUTE: "This headline will convert better"
HYPOTHESIS: "Test this headline against current. Expected: 15-20% lift based on clarity improvement"

ABSOLUTE: "Remove this section"
HYPOTHESIS: "This section may cause friction. Test removal against control"
```

**Rule:** Frame changes as testable hypotheses. Provide expected impact and reasoning.
