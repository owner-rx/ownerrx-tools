# Outreach Message Templates

8 proven outreach templates. Each one has a specific use case, structure, psychology, and example. Select templates based on the situation, then personalize completely.

---

## Template 1: Taking on New Projects

**When to use:** Cold outreach when you want a soft, referral-style approach. Works on any platform. Great for agencies and service providers.

**Psychology:** Asking "know anyone?" is less threatening than asking for a meeting directly. It gives the prospect an easy out while still planting the seed. Most people who respond will refer themselves.

**Structure:**
```
Hey [name],

We're taking on new projects for [offer].

Know anyone who might benefit?

[percentage] referral fee.

Cheers!
```

**Example:**
```
Hey Sarah,

We're taking on new projects for custom AI agents and workflow automation.

Know anyone who might benefit?

15% referral fee.

Cheers!
```

**Platform fit:** LinkedIn, Email, X DM
**Best for:** Service businesses, agencies, freelancers

## Template 2: Case Study

**When to use:** When you have a strong, specific result to share. Best for prospects who are data-driven and need proof before engaging.

**Psychology:** Leading with a third-party result feels less salesy than pitching directly. The case study does the selling. Ending with "do you know someone" keeps the pressure low.

**Structure:**
```
Hey [name],

My [agency/company] helps [ICP] [achieve the desired goal] with [solving pain point].

Last month, we [specific case study with numbers].

Do you know someone who might benefit from this?

Thanks!
```

**Example:**
```
Hey John,

My agency helps B2B software companies ship enterprise features faster with less engineering overhead.

Last month, we built a white-label analytics dashboard for a B2B SaaS team. Costed 20% less than if their core engineers built it.

Do you know someone who might benefit from this?

Thanks!
```

**Platform fit:** Email, LinkedIn
**Best for:** Anyone with a recent win or measurable result to show

## Template 3: Firstline (Personalized Observation)

**When to use:** When you found something specific about the prospect (bad reviews, outdated website, social media gap, hiring signals, recent news). The most effective cold template when done right.

**Psychology:** The personalized first line proves you did research. It signals effort. Prospects respond because the message clearly isn't mass-sent.

**Structure:**
```
Hey [name],

[Specific observation about their business].

We just helped [company] [achieve specific result].

Can I send you a quick video explaining more?
```

**Example:**
```
Hey John,

Saw a couple of bad Google reviews on your page so wanted to see if I can help.

We just helped Acme rank #1 on ChatGPT and increased their MRR by 11% in 45 days.

Can I send you a quick video explaining more?
```

**Platform fit:** LinkedIn, Email, X DM
**Best for:** Highly targeted outreach where you've done research on the prospect

## Template 4: Mutual Connection

**When to use:** When you share a mutual connection, attended the same event, are in the same community, or follow the same thought leader. Warm intros convert 5-10x better than cold.

**Psychology:** Name-dropping a mutual connection builds instant trust. The prospect's guard drops because you're no longer a stranger. Even a shared community or event works.

**Structure:**
```
Hey [name],

[Mutual connection / shared context] mentioned you might be dealing with [pain point].

We just wrapped a project doing [specific result] for [similar company].

Worth a quick 10-min chat?
```

**Example:**
```
Hey Mike,

We're both in the SaaS Growth community and I saw your post about struggling with churn.

We just helped a B2B SaaS company cut churn by 18% in 60 days with a custom onboarding flow.

Worth a quick 10-min chat to see if something similar could work for you?
```

**Platform fit:** LinkedIn, Email
**Best for:** Warm-ish outreach, community-based selling, conference follow-ups

---

## Template 5: Loom / Video Teaser

**When to use:** When you want to stand out in a crowded inbox. Record a short 1-2 min video showing something specific about their business (an audit, a suggestion, a quick win). Send the link.

**Psychology:** A personalized video is impossible to fake at scale. It signals extreme effort and care. Prospects watch because curiosity wins. The "no pitch" framing removes resistance.

**Structure:**
```
Hey [name],

Made a quick 2-min video breaking down [specific thing about their business].

[link]

No pitch, just thought it'd be useful.
```

**Example:**
```
Hey Lisa,

Made a quick 2-min video breaking down 3 things I'd change on your landing page to increase conversions.

[loom link]

No pitch, just thought it'd be useful.
```

**Platform fit:** Email, LinkedIn (link in follow-up, not first DM)
**Best for:** High-value prospects worth the extra effort. Agency owners, consultants, coaches.

**Note:** On LinkedIn, don't include links in the first DM. LinkedIn suppresses messages with links. Use this as a follow-up or switch to email.

---

## Template 6: Value-First

**When to use:** When you notice something specific about their business and can offer a quick, actionable suggestion for free. You lead with value before asking for anything.

**Psychology:** Giving before asking triggers reciprocity. The prospect feels like they owe you something. Even if they don't reply, they remember you. If your suggestion is actually good, you've demonstrated competence without a pitch.

**Structure:**
```
Hey [name],

Noticed [specific observation about their business].

Quick thought - [one actionable suggestion].

We did this for [company] and [specific result].

Happy to share more if useful.
```

**Example:**
```
Hey David,

Noticed your checkout page has 6 form fields. That's usually where 30-40% of drop-offs happen.

Quick thought - cutting it to 3 fields and adding a progress bar could bump your conversion by 15-20%.

We did this for an ecom brand last month and their checkout rate went from 2.1% to 3.4%.

Happy to share more if useful.
```

**Platform fit:** Email, LinkedIn
**Best for:** Consultants, agencies, anyone who can spot quick wins in a prospect's business

## Template 7: Permission-Based

**When to use:** When you want to be respectful of the prospect's time and let them opt in. Works especially well for senior decision-makers who get bombarded with pitches daily.

**Psychology:** Asking for permission flips the dynamic. Instead of pushing, you're inviting. Senior prospects respect this because it shows awareness of their time. The "no pressure" line removes the last barrier to replying.

**Structure:**
```
Hey [name],

We help [ICP] [achieve result] without [common objection or pain].

Would it be okay if I sent over a quick breakdown of how it works?

No pressure either way.
```

**Example:**
```
Hey Rachel,

We help DTC brands scale to $50K/mo in ad spend without burning through creative every 2 weeks.

Would it be okay if I sent over a quick breakdown of how it works?

No pressure either way.
```

**Platform fit:** LinkedIn, Email, X DM
**Best for:** C-suite outreach, high-ticket offers, senior decision-makers

---

## Template 8: Breakup / Last Touch

**When to use:** As the final message in any sequence. Also works as a standalone re-engagement message for prospects who went cold.

**Psychology:** The breakup message works because of loss aversion. When you signal you're about to stop reaching out, the prospect feels the potential loss of the opportunity. It also shows confidence: you're not desperate, you have other prospects.

**Structure:**
```
Hey [name],

Tried reaching out a couple of times so I'll keep this short.

If [solving their pain point] isn't a priority right now, totally get it.

But if it is, happy to chat for 10 min this week.

Either way, wishing you the best!
```

**Example:**
```
Hey Tom,

Tried reaching out a couple of times so I'll keep this short.

If cutting your customer acquisition cost isn't a priority right now, totally get it.

But if it is, happy to chat for 10 min this week.

Either way, wishing you the best with the launch!
```

**Platform fit:** LinkedIn, Email
**Best for:** Final message in any sequence. Re-engaging cold prospects.
