# Outreach Sequence Strategy

How to structure multi-message outreach sequences that get replies and book calls. Based on patterns from top cold outreach practitioners including Client Ascension methodology and proven B2B outreach frameworks.

## Core Principle: Every Message Must Earn Its Place

A follow-up is NOT a reminder. If your follow-up says "just checking in" or "bumping this up," delete it and start over. Each message in the sequence must:

1. Introduce a new angle, new proof, or new value
2. Feel like a standalone message (not dependent on the previous one being read)
3. Lower the commitment bar progressively
4. Sound like a different conversation, not a repeated one

## The 3-Message Sequence (Default)

This is the standard structure. Use it unless the user asks for more or fewer messages.

### Message 1: The Hook (Day 1)
**Purpose:** Open the conversation. Make them curious enough to reply.

**Rules:**
- Lead with them, not you
- One specific hook (case study, observation, referral angle, or value-first)
- Soft CTA: "Worth a quick chat?" or "Can I send more info?"
- Keep it the shortest message in the sequence

**Best templates:** Taking on New Projects, Firstline, Case Study, Permission-Based

### Message 2: The Value Add (Day 3-4)
**Purpose:** Give them a reason to engage even if Message 1 didn't land.

**Rules:**
- Do NOT reference Message 1 ("just following up on my last message")
- Add new value: share a resource, case study, quick tip, or insight
- Can include a link (to a Loom, case study, or article)
- Slightly longer than Message 1 is okay
- CTA can be slightly more direct: "Want me to break this down for you?"

**Best templates:** Value-First, Loom / Video Teaser, Case Study (different angle)

### Message 3: The Breakup (Day 7-10)
**Purpose:** Create urgency through loss aversion. Last touch, low pressure.

**Rules:**
- Acknowledge you've reached out before (briefly)
- Give them an easy out: "If this isn't a priority, totally get it"
- One final, low-pressure CTA
- Keep it the most casual message in the sequence
- End on a positive note regardless

**Best template:** Breakup / Last Touch

## The 5-Message Sequence (Extended)

For email campaigns or when the user wants a longer drip. Space messages further apart.

| Message | Day | Purpose | Angle |
|---------|-----|---------|-------|
| 1 | Day 1 | Hook | Lead with the strongest template for the situation |
| 2 | Day 3 | Social proof | Share a case study or result |
| 3 | Day 7 | Value-first | Give a quick win, tip, or resource |
| 4 | Day 14 | New angle | Reframe the offer or address a common objection |
| 5 | Day 21 | Breakup | Low pressure final touch |

---

## The Single Message (One-Shot)

Sometimes the user just needs one killer message. In this case:

- Pick the single best template for the situation
- Make it slightly more complete than a sequence opener
- Include both the hook AND the proof in one message
- Keep the CTA clear and low-commitment

---

## Platform-Specific Sequence Rules

### LinkedIn DM Sequences
- **First message:** No links. LinkedIn suppresses messages with URLs. Keep it under 300 characters.
- **Second message:** Can include a link (Loom, case study, article). Can go slightly longer.
- **Third message:** Short breakup. Under 200 characters is fine.
- **Connection request note:** If you're not connected yet, the connection request IS your first message. Keep it under 300 characters. Then the sequence starts after they accept.
- **Timing:** If they viewed your profile after Message 1, send Message 2 sooner (Day 2 instead of Day 3-4).

### Email Sequences
- **Subject lines:** 3-5 words, lowercase, no clickbait, no emojis. Examples: "quick question", "thought about your team", "re: [their company]", "[mutual connection] mentioned you"
- **Follow-up subjects:** Can reply to the same thread (no new subject) or use a fresh subject. Fresh subject = higher open rate. Same thread = less inbox clutter.
- **Signature:** Minimal. Name, title, company, one link (website or calendar). No quotes, no banners, no social icons.
- **Timing:** Tuesdays through Thursdays, 8-10am in the prospect's timezone. Avoid Mondays and Fridays.

### X / Twitter DM Sequences
- **Max 2 messages.** Three feels like spam on X.
- **Keep it ultra-casual.** No "Hey [name]," formality. Just dive in.
- **Reference their content.** "Saw your tweet about X" is the best opener on this platform.

### Instagram DM Sequences
- **Max 2 messages.** Same as X.
- **React to a story first** if possible. It warms the conversation before your pitch.
- **Very casual.** Instagram is the most informal platform.

## Follow-Up Angle Rotation

Never use the same angle twice in a sequence. Rotate through these:

| Angle | What it looks like |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Social proof** | "We just helped [company] achieve [result]" |
| **Quick win** | "Noticed [thing] - here's a suggestion that could help" |
| **Resource share** | "Made a quick video/guide breaking down [topic]" |
| **Objection handling** | "Most people worry about [objection]. Here's how we handle it" |
| **Scarcity** | "We're taking on 2 more clients this month" |
| **Breakup** | "Last note from me - no pressure" |

---

## Timing Rules

| Gap | When to use |
|-----|------------|
| 2-3 days | Between Messages 1 and 2 (strike while warm) |
| 4-7 days | Between Messages 2 and 3 (give space) |
| 7-14 days | Between Messages 3+ in extended sequences |
| 1 day | Only if they opened/clicked but didn't reply (email only, requires tracking) |

**Never send two messages on the same day.** It looks desperate.

**If they reply at any point**, stop the sequence and have a real conversation. Do not send the next pre-written message.

---

## Subject Line Formulas (Email Only)

Keep subject lines short, lowercase, and curiosity-driven. No clickbait.

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| quick question | quick question |
| [their company] + [topic] | acme + onboarding |
| re: [topic] | re: your hiring post |
| [mutual connection] mentioned you | sarah mentioned you |
| idea for [their company] | idea for acme |
| [number] + [result] | 11% more conversions |
| [first name]? | john? |

## What Makes Outreach Fail

Avoid these at all costs:

1. **Talking about yourself first.** "Hi, I'm John from Acme Agency and we..." Nobody cares. Lead with them.
2. **Being vague.** "We help companies grow" means nothing. Be specific about who, what, and how much.
3. **Sounding like AI.** If the message has em dashes, "leverage," "streamline," or "I hope this finds you well," it's going straight to trash.
4. **Writing too much.** If your first cold message is longer than 5 sentences, cut it in half.
5. **No social proof.** Claims without evidence get ignored. One case study beats ten claims.
6. **Generic follow-ups.** "Just following up" is the fastest way to get archived.
7. **Weak CTA.** "Let me know if you're interested" is weak. "Worth a 10-min chat this week?" is direct.
8. **Sending on weekends.** Business outreach on Saturday = ignored on Monday morning.
