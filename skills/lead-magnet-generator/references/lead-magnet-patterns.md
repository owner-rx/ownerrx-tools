# Lead Magnet Post Patterns

This reference contains proven patterns for lead magnet giveaway posts that maximize comments and DM opt-ins.

> **Note:** Opening hooks are generated using `viral-hook-creator` patterns. This file focuses on value anchors, CTAs, and post structure.

## The Psychology

Lead magnet posts work because they stack three psychological triggers:
1. **Viral hook** — Stops the scroll with curiosity (from viral-hook-creator)
2. **Value perception** — "This is worth real money"
3. **Low friction** — "All I have to do is comment"

Miss any of these and engagement drops significantly.

## Value Anchor Patterns

Value anchors make the free offer feel valuable. Without them, people assume it's low quality.

### Direct Price Anchors
- "Could easily charge $[X] for this."
- "This would cost $[X] from a consultant."
- "Worth at least $[X] based on what's inside."
- "Normally $[X]."

### Scarcity/Urgency Anchors
- "Will charge $[X] for it in [Y] days."
- "Free for the next 48 hours."
- "Going behind a paywall next week."
- "First [X] people only."

### Social Proof Anchors
- "[X] people have already grabbed this."
- "[X]+ downloads in the first week."
- "The same framework [notable person/company] uses."

### Implicit Value Anchors
- "What I wish I had when I started..."
- "This took me [X] years to figure out..."
- "The exact [thing] I used to [achieve result]..."

## CTA Patterns

The CTA must be crystal clear and low friction.

## Trigger Word Selection

The trigger word should be:
- **Relevant** to the lead magnet (FRAMEWORK, CHECKLIST, TEMPLATE, GUIDE, etc.)
- **Memorable** and easy to type
- **Uppercase** for visibility

### Common Trigger Words by Lead Magnet Type
- Framework → "FRAMEWORK"
- Checklist → "CHECKLIST" or "LIST"
- Template → "TEMPLATE"
- Course → "COURSE" or "FREE"
- Guide → "GUIDE"
- Playbook → "PLAYBOOK"
- Swipe file → "SWIPE"
- Tool/Software → "TOOL" or product name
- Blueprint → "BLUEPRINT"
- Custom/Specific → Use the product name (e.g., "SKILL")

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Weak opening hook** — Generic opener vs viral hook pattern with trigger words
2. **No value anchor** — Without price context, free feels worthless
3. **Vague bullets** — "Useful tips" vs "47 email subject lines that got 60%+ open rates"
4. **Complex CTA** — More than 2 steps kills conversion
5. **Wrong trigger word** — Generic words like "YES" or "ME" get lost in comments
6. **Missing "must be following"** — You can't DM non-followers on most platforms
7. **Too salesy** — Lead magnet posts should feel generous, not pushy

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Twitter/X
- Long-form posts work well
- "Must be following" is essential for DMs
- Repost requests can double reach
- Thread format can work for very detailed lead magnets

### LinkedIn
- "Connect with me" is necessary (can't message non-connections)
- More professional tone, but still direct
- "Repost for priority" creates urgency
- Avoid hashtags in the main post body
