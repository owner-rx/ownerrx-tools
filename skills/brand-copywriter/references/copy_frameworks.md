## Framework Details

### 1. AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)

**The universal framework.** Works for almost any copy type. When in doubt, start here.

**Works well for:**
- Social media ads (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter/X)
- Landing pages and sales pages
- Email campaigns and newsletters
- YouTube ads and video scripts
- Product launches and announcements
- Webinar and event promotions
- Blog post intros and CTAs
- App store descriptions
- Print ads and billboards
- Pitch decks and presentations

**Why it works:** Forces the classic funnel structure. Grabs attention, builds logical progression, creates desire, drives action. Flexible enough to adapt to any length or platform.

**Use when:** You need a reliable structure that works anywhere. Great default when unsure which framework to use.

**Structure:**
- **A - Attention:** Hook that stops the scroll. Bold claim, question, surprising stat, or pattern interrupt.
- **I - Interest:** Explain why this matters. Connect to their world. Build curiosity.
- **D - Desire:** Build emotional want. Show transformation, benefits, social proof. Make them feel the outcome.
- **A - Action:** Clear CTA. Tell them exactly what to do next.

**Example (Facebook Ad):**
```
[Attention] Tired of wasting money on ads that don't convert?
[Interest] Most businesses burn 60% of their ad budget on the wrong audience.
[Desire] Imagine knowing exactly who will buy before you spend a dollar.
[Action] Get our targeting framework free. Link in bio.
```

**Example (Landing Page Headline):**
```
[Attention] Your competitors are stealing your customers while you sleep.
[Interest] 73% of buyers choose the first solution they find.
[Desire] Be that first solution with AI-powered SEO that ranks in 30 days.
[Action] Start your free trial →
```

**Example (Email Subject + Opening):**
```
[Attention] Subject: The $50K mistake I made last quarter
[Interest] I thought more features = more sales. I was dead wrong.
[Desire] After cutting 40% of our product, revenue jumped 3x.
[Action] Here's the exact framework I used (steal it) →
```

### 2. PAS (Problem → Agitate → Solution)

**The pain-driven powerhouse.** Fast, emotional, and direct. One of the most versatile frameworks.

**Works well for:**
- Short-form social ads (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter/X)
- UGC and influencer scripts
- Landing page headlines and hero sections
- Email subject lines and openers
- Cold outreach messages
- Product descriptions for problem-solving products
- LinkedIn posts
- Video ad scripts
- Sales page sections
- App notifications and push messages

**Why it works:** Hits the emotional trigger hard and fast. Creates urgency through pain amplification. People are motivated more by avoiding pain than gaining pleasure.

**Use when:** Your product solves a clear pain point. Works for SaaS, health, fitness, productivity, finance — anything where the "before" state hurts.

**Structure:**
- **P - Problem:** State the pain clearly. Make them feel seen and understood.
- **A - Agitate:** Twist the knife. Show consequences of not solving it. Future-pace the pain.
- **S - Solution:** Present your product as the relief. Show the way out.

**Example (Social Ad):**
```
[Problem] Your calendar is chaos. Meetings eat your entire day.
[Agitate] Every hour wasted in pointless meetings is an hour you'll never get back. Your projects pile up. Your stress compounds. Your best ideas die in your inbox.
[Solution] TimeBlock AI automatically protects your focus time. No more death by calendar.
```

**Example (Cold Email):**
```
[Problem] Hiring takes 3 months and burns $15K per role.
[Agitate] Meanwhile, your team is drowning, projects slip, and your best people start eyeing the door.
[Solution] Our pre-vetted talent pool fills roles in 2 weeks. Same quality, 70% less cost.
```

**Example (LinkedIn Post):**
```
[Problem] Most founders work IN their business, not ON it.
[Agitate] You're the bottleneck. Every decision waits for you. Vacations feel impossible. Growth stalls at your capacity.
[Solution] Here's the delegation framework that freed up 20 hours of my week ↓
```

### 3. BAB (Before → After → Bridge)

**The transformation framework.** Perfect for showing the journey from pain to possibility.

**Works well for:**
- Transformation-focused ads (fitness, coaching, courses)
- SaaS and productivity tools (show the workflow improvement)
- Case study formats
- LinkedIn posts and thought leadership
- Video testimonials structure
- Landing page hero sections
- Email sequences
- Sales conversations
- Before/after content
- Personal brand storytelling

**Why it works:** Humans are wired for stories. BAB creates an instant mental movie of transformation. The "After" creates desire; the "Bridge" creates action.

**Use when:** You want the viewer to instantly imagine the improved version of themselves or their business.

**Structure:**
- **B - Before:** Paint their current painful reality. Make it specific and relatable.
- **A - After:** Show the transformed state they desire. Make it vivid and emotional.
- **B - Bridge:** Your product/solution is the path from before to after.

**Example (Coaching/Course Ad):**
```
[Before] 3 months ago, I was working 70-hour weeks and still behind on everything.
[After] Now I work 35 hours and my revenue doubled.
[Bridge] The difference? I replaced 12 tools with one system. Here's the exact setup.
```

**Example (SaaS Landing Page):**
```
[Before] Before: Spreadsheets, sticky notes, and 47 browser tabs. Projects falling through cracks.
[After] After: One dashboard. Every task tracked. Nothing forgotten. Home by 6.
[Bridge] ProjectFlow is the system that makes it happen. Try it free.
```

**Example (LinkedIn Post):**
```
[Before] 2 years ago I was mass-applying to jobs. 200 applications. 3 interviews. 0 offers.
[After] Last month I had 5 companies competing for me. Negotiated 40% above asking.
[Bridge] The difference? I stopped applying and started positioning. Here's how ↓
```

### 4. FAB (Features → Advantages → Benefits)

**The product-focused framework.** Translates specs into desire.

**Works well for:**
- E-commerce product descriptions
- Tech and gadget ads
- SaaS feature announcements
- App store descriptions
- Product comparison pages
- Sales enablement materials
- Amazon listings
- Spec sheets that need to sell
- LinkedIn product posts
- Email product announcements

**Why it works:** Quickly answers the three questions buyers ask: What is it? Why is it better? What do I get? Bridges the gap between features and emotional outcomes.

**Use when:** Your product has clear features that drive tangible benefits. Great for tech, gadgets, software, and physical products.

**Structure:**
- **F - Features:** What the product has or does (specs, capabilities, components).
- **A - Advantages:** Why that feature matters vs alternatives. The "so what?"
- **B - Benefits:** What the customer actually gets (emotional/practical outcome).

**Example (E-commerce):**
```
[Feature] 48-hour battery life.
[Advantage] Most headphones die in 8 hours. These last your entire work week.
[Benefit] Never interrupt your flow to charge. Just grab and go.
```

**Example (SaaS Feature):**
```
[Feature] AI-powered inbox sorting.
[Advantage] Unlike filters that miss context, it learns what matters to YOU.
[Benefit] Start your day with the 5 emails that actually need attention. Ignore the rest.
```

**Example (App Store):**
```
[Feature] Offline mode with full sync.
[Advantage] Competitors require constant internet. We don't.
[Benefit] Work from planes, subways, or that cabin with zero bars. Pick up exactly where you left off.
```

### 5. 4Cs (Clear → Concise → Compelling → Credible)

**The editing framework.** Not a writing structure — a quality filter.

**Use for:** Refining ANY copy written with another framework. Apply as a final polish.

**Checklist:**
- **Clear:** Is the message instantly understandable? No jargon or ambiguity?
- **Concise:** Can any word be cut without losing meaning? Is every sentence earning its place?
- **Compelling:** Does it create desire or urgency? Would YOU click/buy/act?
- **Credible:** Is there proof? Stats? Social proof? Does it feel real?

**Pro tip:** Read your copy aloud. If you stumble, it's not clear. If you're bored, it's not compelling.

---

### 6. 5-Point Copy Formula (Promise → Picture → Proof → Push → Prompt)

**The persuasion complete package.** Covers all bases: emotion, visualization, credibility, urgency.

**Works well for:**
- Product launches and announcements
- Sales pages (short to medium length)
- Crowdfunding campaigns
- Course and program sales
- High-ticket offers
- Webinar pitches
- Facebook/Instagram ads with social proof
- Email sales sequences
- Landing pages with strong testimonials

**Why it works:** Creates vivid desire AND backs it up with proof in one flow. Doesn't rely on just emotion or just logic — uses both.

**Use when:** You have strong testimonials, case studies, or data to lean on. Great for offers where credibility drives conversion.

**Structure:**
- **Promise:** Make a bold, specific claim about the outcome.
- **Picture:** Help them visualize having that outcome. Paint the scene.
- **Proof:** Back it up with testimonials, stats, case studies.
- **Push:** Create urgency. Why act now?
- **Prompt:** Clear, specific CTA.

```
[Promise] Double your email open rates in 14 days.
[Picture] Imagine waking up to replies from dream clients instead of crickets. Your inbox becomes a revenue stream, not a time sink.
[Proof] 2,400+ marketers have used this system. Average improvement: 127%. "Went from 12% to 41% opens in week one." — Sarah K.
[Push] We're closing enrollment Friday. Only 50 spots left at this price.
[Prompt] Grab your spot now →
```

### 7. PASTOR (Problem → Amplify → Story → Transformation → Offer → Response)

- VSLs (video sales letters)
- Email sequences (spread across multiple emails)
- Complex products requiring education
- High-ticket coaching and consulting offers

**Why it works:** Story-driven and methodical. Builds emotional investment before asking for the sale. Perfect for higher-priced or complex offers.

**Use when:** Your product needs narrative appeal, the buyer journey is longer, or you're selling something that requires trust.

**Structure:**
- **P - Problem:** Identify and describe the pain in detail.
- **A - Amplify:** Make the problem feel urgent and serious. Stakes and consequences.
- **S - Story:** Tell a relatable story (yours or a customer's).
- **T - Transformation:** Show the before/after change vividly.
- **O - Offer:** Present your solution and everything they get.

**Structure:**
- **A - Awareness:** Make them aware of the problem or opportunity they didn't know existed.
- **C - Comprehension:** Help them understand the solution and how it works.
- **C - Conviction:** Build belief through proof, benefits, and trust signals.
- **A - Action:** Clear CTA.

**Example (B2B SaaS):**
```

[Comprehension] Our platform auto-generates internal pitch decks your champions can share. One click, personalized for their stakeholders.
