|------|-------|----------|-------|
| Background (Dark) | Deep Navy | #0A0F1C | Primary backgrounds, slide backgrounds, dark sections |
| Background (Medium) | Dark Slate | #111827 | Card backgrounds, secondary sections, containers |
| Accent (Primary) | Bright Blue | #2563EB | Buttons, CTAs, links, key highlights, interactive elements |

| Text (Tertiary) | Medium Gray | #9CA3AF | Captions, footnotes, subtle text |

### Gradient Definitions

- **Hero Gradient (text)**: linear-gradient from #4ADE80 to #22C55E — use for impactful headlines and key phrases
- **Background Gradient**: subtle radial gradient from #111827 center to #0A0F1C edges — adds depth to backgrounds
- **CTA Gradient**: #2563EB to #1D4ED8 — for buttons and call-to-action elements

### Color Application Rules

- Always use dark backgrounds (#0A0F1C or #111827) as the base
- Never use light/white backgrounds unless specifically requested
- Reserve bright blue (#2563EB) for interactive elements and key highlights only — do not overuse
- Green gradient text (#4ADE80 → #22C55E) is for hero headlines and key value propositions only
- Body text should always be #D1D5DB on dark backgrounds for readability
- Maintain a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for all text

## Typography

### Font Stack

| Role | Font | Weight | Size Guidelines |
|------|------|--------|----------------|
| Headlines / Titles | Montserrat | Bold (700) | 36-60pt presentations, 24-36pt documents |
| Subheadings | Montserrat | SemiBold (600) | 24-32pt presentations, 18-24pt documents |
| Body Text | Inter | Regular (400) | 18-22pt presentations, 11-12pt documents |
| Captions / Labels | Inter | Medium (500) | 14-16pt presentations, 9-10pt documents |
| Accent Text / Stats | Montserrat | ExtraBold (800) | For big numbers, key statistics |

### Typography Rules

- Headlines: ALL CAPS for impact titles, Title Case for standard headings
- Keep line spacing at 1.4x–1.6x for body text
- Maximum 2 font families per deliverable (Montserrat + Inter)
- Never use decorative or script fonts
- For presentations: limit text to 6 words per line, 6 lines per slide (the 6x6 rule)

## Visual Style

### Layout Principles

- **Clean and spacious**: generous whitespace, avoid clutter
- **Left-aligned text**: default alignment for readability (center-align only for hero slides)
- **Grid-based layouts**: use consistent margins and alignment guides
- **Dark-first design**: dark mode aesthetic matches the tech-forward Pedro Valera Digital brand

### Graphic Elements

- Use subtle geometric shapes (circles, lines, rounded rectangles) as decorative accents
- Gradient overlays on images: semi-transparent #0A0F1C at 60-80% opacity
- Icon style: outlined/linear icons, not filled — modern and clean
- Border radius: 8-12px for cards and containers (rounded but not pill-shaped)
- Subtle glow effects around key elements using #2563EB at low opacity

### Image Treatment

- All images should have a dark overlay to maintain brand consistency
- Prefer abstract tech imagery, professional photography, or clean illustrations
- Avoid clip art, stock photos that look staged, or overly generic imagery

## Content Tone

- **Professional but approachable**: expert knowledge delivered in plain language
- **Empowering**: position the audience as capable decision-makers
- **Action-oriented**: every section should drive toward a clear next step
- **Data-informed**: back claims with statistics, metrics, and real outcomes
