Create a branded one-pager for: $ARGUMENTS

Before starting, read these skill files for guidance:
- @${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/brand-identity/SKILL.md
- @${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/brand-identity/references/deliverable-specs.md
- @${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/storytelling-framework/SKILL.md

Follow these steps:

1. **Understand the context**: Ask the user (if not already provided):
   - What is this one-pager for? (Product overview, event summary, executive brief, service offering?)
   - Who will read it?

2. **Apply IGNITE in compressed form**: Even a single page follows the narrative arc:
   - Header: Hook headline that identifies the pain or opportunity
   - Body: Solution + proof in 3 key points
   - Footer: Single CTA

3. **Write the content**:
   - **Header**: Logo, title (max 8 words), date or version
   - **Hero section**: One powerful headline + 1-2 sentence hook
   - **3 Key Points**: Icon-worthy points with 2-3 sentence descriptions each
   - **Supporting data**: One compelling metric, chart, or testimonial
   - **CTA**: Clear next step with contact information
   - **Footer**: Brand details, website, social

4. **Apply brand identity**: Dark background, Pedro Valera Digital colors, Montserrat headings, Inter body. Two or three-column layout for easy scanning. Every element must earn its space.

5. **Create the file**: Build as a PDF using the pdf skill. Single page, Letter or A4.

6. **Quality check**: Print test — can someone understand the key message in under 30 seconds? Is the CTA unmissable? Is every word essential?
