# Content Frameworks

Three content frameworks for structuring any deliverable. Choose the framework that best matches the content goal.

## Framework Selection Guide

| Framework | Best for | Core goal |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **IGNITE** | Keynotes, pitch decks, sales content, marketing | Persuade and move to action |
| **EDUCATE** | Workshops, training, tutorials, onboarding | Teach and build capability |
| **REPORT** | Data reviews, quarterly reports, dashboards, analysis | Inform and recommend |

**Rule**: If unsure which framework to use, ask the user what they want the audience to *do* after consuming the content:
- "Buy, sign up, or take action" → IGNITE
- "Learn and apply a new skill" → EDUCATE
- "Understand data and make decisions" → REPORT

## IGNITE Framework (Persuasion)

A six-stage narrative arc designed to move audiences from attention to action.

### I — Identify the Pain

Open by naming the exact problem the audience faces. Be specific and direct.

**Psychology**: Pattern Interrupt + Problem Awareness. The brain pays attention to threats and unsolved problems. Naming their pain signals understanding.

**How to apply**:
- Lead with a question that surfaces the pain: "How many hours this week did you spend on [painful task]?"
- Use a surprising statistic that quantifies the problem
- Tell a 2-sentence micro-story about someone experiencing the pain
- Use second person ("you") to make it personal

### G — Gauge the Stakes

Amplify what happens if the problem goes unsolved. Create honest urgency.

**Psychology**: Loss Aversion. People are 2x more motivated to avoid losses than to pursue gains. Show what they stand to lose.

**How to apply**:
- Project the cost of inaction over time (monthly, yearly)
- Compare where they are vs. where competitors are heading
- Use "If nothing changes..." framing
- Keep it to 1-2 slides or paragraphs — don't dwell

### N — Narrate the Turning Point

Introduce a shift — a story, discovery, or insight that changed everything. Bridge from problem to solution.

**Psychology**: Hero's Journey "Crossing the Threshold." Your audience is the hero — you are the guide.

**How to apply**:
- Share a founder story, client story, or industry inflection point
- Use "That's when we discovered..." or "Here's what changed..."
- Earn trust through vulnerability or insight
- Make the audience see themselves in the story

### I — Introduce the Solution

Present the solution, product, method, or framework. Be clear, concrete, and visual.

**Psychology**: Cognitive Fluency. The easier something is to understand, the more people trust it. Present in 3 steps or fewer.

**How to apply**:
- Frame the solution in 3 simple steps or pillars
- Use a visual diagram, process flow, or before/after comparison
- Lead with the outcome, then explain the mechanism
- No jargon — plain business language

### T — Trust Through Proof

Back up claims with evidence. Audiences need proof before they invest time or money.

**Psychology**: Social Proof + Authority Bias. Combine testimonials with data for maximum credibility.

**How to apply**:
- Client testimonials with specific results ("saved 15 hours/week")
- Case studies with before/after metrics
- Industry data from credible sources
- Your own credentials or experience (briefly)

### E — Empower with Action

Close with a single, clear call to action. Make it easy, specific, and low-friction.

**Psychology**: Decision Fatigue + Commitment/Consistency. One clear CTA outperforms multiple options.

**How to apply**:
- One CTA per deliverable — never give 3 options
- Make the first step small and risk-free ("Book a 15-minute call", "Download the free guide")
- Restate the transformation: "In 30 days, you could be [desired outcome]"
- End with confidence, not desperation

## EDUCATE Framework (Teaching)

A seven-stage instructional design arc for building learner capability.

### E — Establish Baseline

Start by understanding what learners already know. Meet them where they are.

**Principle**: Activate prior knowledge so new information has something to connect to.

**How to apply**:
- Quick poll or show-of-hands: "How many of you have used [tool/concept]?"
- Brief self-assessment: "Rate your familiarity from 1-5"
- Acknowledge the range: "Whether you're just starting or already experienced..."
- Use results to calibrate depth and pacing

### D — Define Objectives

State clearly what learners will be able to do by the end. Measurable outcomes.

**Principle**: Clear goals focus attention and give learners a way to measure their own progress.

**How to apply**:
- Use "By the end of this, you will be able to..." format
- Limit to 3-5 objectives
- Make them action-oriented (create, build, analyze, configure — not "understand" or "appreciate")
- Display objectives visibly and reference them throughout

### U — Unpack Concepts

Break complex ideas into digestible pieces with examples and analogies.

**Principle**: Chunking and scaffolding. Present information in small, connected pieces that build on each other.

**How to apply**:
- One concept per slide or section
- Use analogies to connect new ideas to familiar ones
- Show before explaining — demos and examples first, theory second
- Use visuals: diagrams, flowcharts, before/after comparisons
- Check understanding before moving on: "Does this make sense so far?"

### C — Connect to Practice

Give learners hands-on activities that reinforce concepts immediately.

**Principle**: Active learning. People retain 75% of what they practice vs. 5% of what they hear.

**How to apply**:
- Exercises immediately after each concept (not all at the end)
- Clear instructions: what to do, how long, what to produce
- Pair or group work when possible — peer learning reinforces concepts
- Provide templates or scaffolding so exercises aren't blank-page intimidating
- Debrief each exercise: "What did you discover? What surprised you?"

### A — Assess Understanding

Check comprehension and address gaps before moving forward.

**Principle**: Formative assessment. Catching misunderstandings early prevents compounding confusion.

**How to apply**:
- Quick knowledge checks: "Which of these is correct?"
- Ask learners to explain back in their own words
- Common misconception slides: "Many people think X, but actually..."
- Q&A sections between modules, not just at the end
- Watch for confused faces (in live settings) and address proactively

### T — Transfer to Real World

Show learners exactly how to apply what they learned in their own context.

**Principle**: Transfer of learning. Without explicit connection to real work, knowledge stays theoretical.

**How to apply**:
- "On Monday, you can..." action items
- Templates, checklists, or worksheets they take with them
- Real-world scenarios from their industry
- Ask: "What's one thing you'll implement this week?"
- Provide a simple decision framework for when to apply which technique

### E — Extend Further

Point to next steps, deeper resources, and continued learning paths.

**Principle**: Growth mindset. Learning doesn't end with the session — provide pathways for going deeper.

**How to apply**:
- Recommended resources (books, tools, courses)
- Community or peer group for continued support
- Advanced topics they can explore independently
- Follow-up touchpoint: "In 2 weeks, we'll check in on your progress"
- Challenge: "Try applying this to a different area of your business"

## REPORT Framework (Data & Analysis)

A six-stage structure for presenting data, findings, and recommendations.

### R — Research Context

Explain why this data matters and what prompted the analysis.

**Principle**: Context transforms data from abstract numbers into meaningful information.

**How to apply**:
- State the business question being answered
- Timeframe covered and data sources used
- Any changes in methodology from previous reports
- Who should care about these findings and why

### E — Executive Summary

Present key findings upfront. Decision-makers read this first (and sometimes only this).

**Principle**: Inverted pyramid. Lead with the conclusion, support with details.

**How to apply**:
- 3-5 bullet points maximum
- Each finding stated as a complete insight, not just a metric ("Revenue grew 23% driven by enterprise segment" not "Revenue: +23%")
- Include the recommended action alongside each finding
- Use visual indicators: arrows, color coding, traffic lights for status

### P — Present the Data

Show the numbers with clear, honest visualizations.

**Principle**: Visual clarity. The right chart tells the story faster than any paragraph.

**How to apply**:
- Choose chart types intentionally: bar for comparison, line for trend, pie only for parts-of-whole
- Label everything: axes, units, time periods
- Highlight the key insight on each chart — don't make the reader hunt
- Use brand colors consistently (~~accent-primary for primary metrics, ~~accent-secondary for secondary)
- Include source and date for every data point

### O — Observe Patterns

Analyze trends, correlations, and anomalies in the data.

**Principle**: Analysis adds value beyond what raw data provides. Don't just show — interpret.

**How to apply**:
- Compare to previous periods, benchmarks, or targets
- Call out what's improving, what's declining, and what's unchanged
- Identify correlations: "When X increased, Y also rose"
- Flag anomalies: "This spike in Week 3 was caused by..."
- Use annotations on charts to highlight key patterns

### R — Recommend Actions

State what should be done based on the data. Be specific.

**Principle**: Data without action is trivia. Every report should drive a decision.

**How to apply**:
- 3-5 specific recommendations, prioritized
- Tie each recommendation to a finding: "Because [finding], we should [action]"
- Include expected impact: "This could save X hours/month" or "Projected to increase Y by Z%"
- Assign ownership when possible: "Marketing team should..." or "Engineering to evaluate..."
- Distinguish between quick wins and longer-term initiatives

### T — Track Next Steps

Define KPIs, timelines, and follow-up checkpoints.

**Principle**: Accountability. Without tracking, recommendations become suggestions that fade away.

**How to apply**:
- Table of actions with owner, deadline, and success metric
- Schedule the next review: "We'll revisit these metrics on [date]"
- Define what success looks like: "If we see X by [date], the initiative is working"
- Flag risks: "If Y doesn't improve by [date], we should consider Z"
- Provide a one-page dashboard or scorecard for ongoing tracking
