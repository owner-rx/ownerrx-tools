# Educational Design Patterns

Techniques for effective teaching, training, and tutorial content. Apply these within the EDUCATE framework.

## 1. Scaffolding

Provide temporary supports that help learners succeed, then gradually remove them.

**Application**:
- First exercise: provide a worked example with one blank to fill in
- Second exercise: provide a template with multiple blanks
- Third exercise: start from scratch with only a checklist
- Use "training wheels" — simplified versions of the real task
- Provide sentence starters, partial code, or pre-built frameworks

## 2. Worked Examples

Show the complete solution process, step by step, before asking learners to try.

**Application**:
- Demonstrate the full workflow live before any exercise
- Annotate each step: "I'm doing X because Y"
- Show common mistakes alongside the correct approach
- Use side-by-side comparisons: "A beginner would do X, here's why we do Y instead"
- Provide the worked example as a reference during practice

## 3. Spaced Retrieval

Revisit key concepts at increasing intervals to strengthen memory.

**Application**:
- Quick review of previous module's key points before starting new content
- "Pop quiz" slides that recall earlier material
- End-of-session review that covers all modules
- Follow-up email or resource that revisits the core concepts
- Build on previous exercises — each new exercise should use skills from earlier

## 4. Dual Coding

Present information in both verbal and visual formats simultaneously.

**Application**:
- Pair every concept with a diagram, icon, or visual metaphor
- Use flowcharts alongside procedural text
- Color-code categories consistently throughout
- Annotated screenshots for software tutorials
- Infographics that summarize text-heavy sections

## 5. Cognitive Load Management

Don't overwhelm learners — manage the amount of new information presented at once.

**Application**:
- Maximum 3 new concepts per module
- Remove decorative elements that don't support learning
- Use progressive disclosure: basic concept first, details on demand
- Chunk related information together with clear section breaks
- Provide "rest stops" — reflection or discussion slides between dense content

## 6. Active Recall

Force learners to retrieve information rather than passively review it.

**Application**:
- Ask questions before revealing the answer
- "What do you think happens when..." before showing the result
- Fill-in-the-blank summaries instead of complete review slides
- Case studies where learners predict the outcome before seeing it
- Partner discussions: "Explain [concept] to your neighbor"

## 7. Elaborative Interrogation

Ask "why" and "how" questions that force deeper processing.

**Application**:
- After presenting a fact: "Why do you think this works?"
- Comparison prompts: "How is this different from [previous concept]?"
- Application prompts: "How would you use this in your business?"
- Challenge prompts: "What could go wrong with this approach?"
- Connection prompts: "How does this relate to what we covered in Module 1?"

## 8. The Testing Effect

Being tested on material improves retention more than re-reading it.

**Application**:
- Short quizzes at the end of each module (even informal ones)
- "Which of these is correct?" multiple-choice slides
- Ask learners to list 3 things they learned before checking the summary
- Challenge exercises that combine multiple concepts
- Pre-test at the start to identify gaps, post-test to measure growth

## 9. Concrete Examples Before Abstract Rules

Start with specific examples, then derive the general principle.

**Application**:
- Show a real-world scenario before explaining the theory behind it
- "Here's what Company X did..." before "The principle is..."
- Use case studies as the entry point to concepts
- Let learners discover the pattern: "What do these 3 examples have in common?"
- Use familiar contexts: business situations the audience has experienced

## 10. Feedback Loops

Give immediate, specific feedback on practice attempts.

**Application**:
- Review exercise outputs during the session, not just after
- Provide rubrics so learners can self-assess
- Peer review: have participants give feedback to each other
- Common errors slide: "If you got X, here's why — the correct approach is Y"
- Celebrate progress: "Notice how much faster you are at this now compared to Module 1"
