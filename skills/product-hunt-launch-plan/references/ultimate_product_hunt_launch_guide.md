# Ultimate Guide to Rank #1 on Product Hunt

*Based on Tibo's guide - Maker of the Year 2022 with multiple #1 Product of the Day wins*

---

## Why Product Hunt Matters

Product Hunt has an active and engaged community of tech enthusiasts, early adopters, investors, journalists, and fellow entrepreneurs. The #1 spot can generate approximately:
- 10,000 unique visits
- 1,000-3,000 qualified leads
- Significant press coverage and backlinks
- Investor attention
- Initial traction and validation

---

## PHASE 1: BEFORE THE LAUNCH

### 1.1 Hunter vs. Self-Launch Decision

**Key Statistic:** 79% of featured products were self-hunted, and 60% of #1 products came from makers launching independently.

**Self-launching benefits:**
- Full control over timing
- No coordination overhead
- Direct connection with community
- You can respond faster to comments

**When to use a Hunter:**
- If you have zero Product Hunt presence
- If a top hunter with relevant audience offers genuinely
- Never pay for hunters - it violates PH terms

**Recommendation:** Self-hunt unless you have a compelling reason not to.

---

### 1.2 Setting Your Goals

Aim to build support from around 500 people to reach top-5 ranking.

Define specific targets before launch:
- Target upvote count (500+ for top 5)
- Target comment count (50+ shows engagement)
- Target new user signups
- Target email subscribers

---

### 1.3 Building Your Support List

**Create a spreadsheet with ALL potential supporters:**

| Category | Examples | Priority |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Inner Circle | Friends, family, co-founders | High |
| Professional Network | Co-workers, ex-colleagues | High |
| Social Media Followers | Twitter/X, LinkedIn connections | High |
| Similar Product Upvoters | Use tools like upvote-bell.com | Medium |
| Email Subscribers | Your newsletter list | High |
| Community Members | Indie Hackers, Slack groups, Discord servers | Medium |
| Coming Soon Page Followers | PH teaser page subscribers | High |

**Important:** Ensure supporters have warmed Product Hunt accounts (accounts that have been active, not just created).

---

### 1.4 Community Engagement (Start 2-4 Weeks Before)

**Where to engage:**
- Indie Hackers
- The Product Folks
- Relevant Slack communities
- Discord servers in your niche
- Twitter/X maker community
- Reddit (relevant subreddits)

**How to engage:**
- Upvote and comment on other launches genuinely
- Share helpful insights in communities
- Build relationships, not just ask for favors
- Focus on warm relationships over cold outreach

**Twitter/X Strategy:**
A lot of makers hang out on Twitter. Building an audience there can help with successful launches. If you already have an audience, make sure you leverage it.

---

### 1.5 Prepare All Launch Assets

#### Title
- Use your product name
- No emojis in the title
- Keep it clean and recognizable

#### Tagline (60 characters max)
Craft a compelling tagline explaining your value proposition.

**Great tagline examples:**
- Notion: "One workspace. Every team"
- Slack: "Make work life simpler, more pleasant and more productive"
- Your tagline should answer: What does this do and for whom?

#### Description
- Brief elaboration of your product
- Highlight unique selling points
- Keep it concise - people skim
- Lead with benefits, not features

#### Visual Assets

**Thumbnail (240x240):**
- Eye-catching image or animated GIF
- Your logo or product screenshot
- Must be recognizable at small size

**Gallery Images (1270x760):**
- First image appears in social previews - make it count
- Show benefits, not just features
- Ensure mobile legibility
- Use consistent styling
- 3-5 images is optimal

**Video/Demo (Optional but recommended):**
- Product demonstration or founder walkthrough
- Keep it under 2 minutes
- Show the product in action
- Don't show everything - create curiosity

#### Maker's First Comment
**Critical:** 70% of top performers included maker comments.

Your first comment should:
- Explain why you built this
- Share your personal story/motivation
- Ask for specific feedback
- Invite questions
- Be authentic and human

---

### 1.6 Coming Soon Page

**Schedule your product 1 month in advance.**

Benefits:
- Generates early interest
- Collects email subscribers
- Gets feedback before launch
- Builds anticipation
- Product Hunt promotes Coming Soon products

---

### 1.7 Pre-Launch Marketing Materials

Prepare these BEFORE launch day:

**Social Media Posts:**
- Twitter/X thread announcing launch
- LinkedIn post
- Instagram story/post if relevant
- All posts should include Product Hunt branding

**Direct Messages:**
- Personalized DM templates for different supporter tiers
- Don't copy-paste - personalize each one

**Email Copy:**
- Launch announcement email
- Reminder email (send night before)
- Thank you email (for after launch)

**Marketing Images:**
- Social cards with your Product Hunt link
- Stories/posts celebrating milestones

---

## PHASE 2: LAUNCH DAY EXECUTION

### 2.1 Strategic Timing

**Launch at 12:01 AM PST** to maximize full 24-hour visibility.

**Day Selection:**

| Day | Traffic | Competition | Best For |
|-----|---------|-------------|----------|
| Tuesday | High | High | Strong support base |
| Wednesday | High | High | Strong support base |
| Thursday | High | High | Strong support base |
| Friday | Medium | Medium | Moderate support |
| Weekend | Lower | Lower | Weak support base |

**Key insight:** Product Hunt initially hides vote counts for the first 4 hours, giving all products equal visibility opportunities. First 4 hours are CRITICAL.

---

### 2.2 Launch Day Timeline

**Hour 0 (12:01 AM PST):**
1. Submit your product (if not scheduled)
2. Post your maker comment IMMEDIATELY
3. Send launch email to your list
4. Post on Twitter/X

**Hours 1-4 (Critical Window):**
1. Send individualized DMs starting with warm contacts
2. Message relevant Slack, WhatsApp, and Discord communities
3. Add Product Hunt widget to your website
4. Engage with EVERY comment immediately
5. Post across social media channels
6. Contact known influencers

**Hours 5-12:**
1. Continue responding to all comments
2. Share milestone updates on social media
3. Send reminder to supporters who haven't voted
4. Keep the momentum going with updates

**Hours 13-24:**
1. Final push on social media
2. Thank supporters publicly
3. Engage with late comments
4. Monitor rankings

---

### 2.3 Engagement Strategy

**Share your journey throughout the day:**
- Tweet 10+ times documenting progress

- Behind-the-scenes content
- React to comments publicly
- Show gratitude frequently

**Comment Engagement:**
- Reply to EVERY comment

- Turn critics into fans with thoughtful responses

---

### 2.4 Monitoring Your Launch

Use analytics tools to track:
- Real-time upvote counts
- Ranking position
- Competitor performance
- Traffic sources
- Comment velocity

**Tools:**
- Hunted Space (tracks real-time upvotes)
- Your own analytics dashboard
- Product Hunt's maker dashboard

---

### 2.5 Critical Don'ts

**NEVER do these - they can get you disqualified:**

- Avoid artificial vote manipulation or spam
- Never directly request upvotes publicly (say "check it out" not "upvote please")
- Don't aggressively push for votes from unfamiliar users
- Refrain from appearing overly promotional
- Don't use fake accounts
- Don't pay for upvotes
- Don't send mass automated messages

---

## PHASE 3: AFTER THE LAUNCH

### 3.1 Immediate Actions (Day 1-3)

1. **Thank all supporters** - Public thank you post on social media
2. **Respond to remaining comments** - Don't ghost after launch
3. **Follow up with interested users** - Convert interest to signups
4. **Collect feedback** - Document all suggestions

### 3.2 Capitalize on Results

**If you ranked Top 5:**
- You'll be featured in Product Hunt newsletter

- Share the achievement on social media
- Reach out to press with your results
- Update your marketing with "Top 5 on Product Hunt"

**Add to your website:**

### 3.3 Long-term Value

- Implement user feedback for product improvements
- Convert incoming inquiries into users
- Build relationships with new connections
- Use the experience to iterate future launches

### 3.4 If Results Disappoint

**Don't despair:**
- Multiple launch attempts are normal
- Use insights to refine your approach
- Focus on long-term business goals
- Product Hunt is one channel, not your entire strategy

## HIDDEN GEMS & PRO TIPS

### Tip 1: Warm Up Supporter Accounts
Accounts that are new or inactive carry less weight. Ask supporters to:
- Create PH account 2+ weeks before
- Upvote and comment on other products
- Complete their profile

### Tip 2: The First Comment Strategy
Your maker comment can get upvoted too. A highly upvoted first comment shows engagement and attracts more attention.

### Tip 3: Timing Your Outreach
Don't ask everyone to upvote at once. Spread it throughout the day to maintain steady momentum rather than a spike that dies.

### Tip 4: The Reciprocity Play
In weeks before launch, genuinely support other makers' launches. They'll often return the favor.

### Tip 5: Create FOMO Content
Share live updates creating fear of missing out:
- "Just hit 200 upvotes in 2 hours!"
- "Can't believe we're #2 right now!"

### Tip 6: Leverage Time Zones
Coordinate supporters across time zones to maintain 24-hour momentum.

### Tip 7: The Personal Touch
Personalized DMs convert 3-5x better than mass messages. Reference something specific about the person.

### Tip 8: Comments > Upvotes
Engagement signals matter. A product with fewer upvotes but more comments often ranks higher.

### Tip 9: Prepare for Success
Have your onboarding ready for a traffic surge. Nothing worse than winning PH and having your site crash.

### Tip 10: The Relaunch Option
You can launch major updates as new products. Plan for version 2.0 launch if first attempt underperforms.

## SUCCESS PATTERNS FROM #1 PRODUCTS

### Pattern 1: Community-Driven (Carrd)
Built anticipation through early user engagement long before launch.

### Pattern 2: Marketing-Intensive (Visme)
Leveraged partnerships, email campaigns, and coordinated promotion.

### Pattern 3: Product Excellence (Whereby)
Relied on superior user experience and word-of-mouth.

**Best approach:** Combine all three - great product + community + marketing.
