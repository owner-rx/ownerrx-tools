I've built and scaled SaaS MVPs to $10,000,000 ARR.

If I had a working SaaS MVP today, this is how I'd get to my first $1k MRR:

- Build in public
- Email users early
- Use Reddit for distribution
- Launch on Product Hunt
- Offer early lifetime deals
- DM relentlessly
- Add affiliates

Simple, not easy.

Do this for 30 consecutive days and I guarantee you'll gain traction.

So many ways to scale without ads or SEO.

Yet, people still think they need $5k to start.

### Post #21

I wrote my first tweet 19 months ago.
I got my first client 18 months ago.
I hit $10,000/mo 12 months ago.
All it takes is just one tweet.
You just need to start.
And keep going.

2022: "This will never work"
2023: "This will never work"

The key is to be delusional enough to believe in yourself.

## Comparison (This vs That)

### Post #31

1st time SaaS founder:

- Builds for 8 months

2nd time SaaS founder:

- Thinks in weeks, not months
- 80% marketing, 20% building
- "I only have 100 people signed up, I still need more validation"

Think like the 2nd founder.

Startup founders that are forever stuck:

Research ➡️ Research ➡️ Research ➡️ "This won't work"

Startup founders that print $$$:

Research ➡️ Execute ➡️ Feedback ➡️ "I need to pivot"

### Post #31

Non-tech SaaS founders who print $$$: I need 1 engineer, I'll figure the rest myself.

Non-tech SaaS founders who are forever stuck: I need a UI expert, team of 5 engineers, 3 sales guys & 10 grams of shrooms to figure out the idea first, let's get it!

- Generate a prototype in Lovable
- Post it to X
- See if it sticks

So many opportunities.

### Post #35

The best SaaS growth loop:

→ show wins or stats

### Post #36

You don't need a better feature.

You need a better default.

Figma.
Airtable.
Superhuman.


All grew because the first experience was delightful.

Not because they had 50 cool features.

### Post #38

Beehiiv solves newsletters
Notion solves productivity
Asana solves collaboration
Calendly solves scheduling
Slack solves communication

Your product?

That's the real question you should be answering.

---

### Post #39

If you're building a collab-based SaaS, always name it so that it can be used as a verb:

"I'll Slack you"
"I'll Loom you"
"I'll WhatsApp you"

Easy to catch on & go viral.

### Post #40

Calendly = basic scheduler

Buffer = landing + waitlist

Mailchimp = plugin turned SaaS

CoSchedule = editorial calendar MVP

Typeform = minimal form builder

Spotify = invite‑only desktop

Instagram = photo‑only Burbn pivot

Twitter = real‑time text updates

Instacart = manual backend app

Airbnb = air‑mattress site

Workiz = locksmith workflow CRM

FloQast = Excel close automator

Savology = finance MVP test

BoosterHub = manual admin tool

Feedbeggar = script feedback widget

---

### Post #41

Here's the strategy that can help your product go viral overnight:

1) Extract 1 feature from your software
2) Spin it up as a dedicated app
3) Don't require a sign-up

Taplio has Carousel Maker
HubSpot has a Website Grader
Grammarly has a Plagiarism Checker

Reduce friction.

---

### Post #42

Netflix started as a DVD rental
Mailchimp was an email plugin
Amazon was an online bookstore
Spotify was an invite-only desktop app
Nomadlist started out as a Google Sheet

Still think you need that one additional feature?

Just ship your MVP.

→ Cursor for coding

Master all 5 and you'll become unstoppable.

## Reverse Advice

### Post #45

How to burnout in your SaaS development 101:

Ignore customer feedback
Push new updates without testing
Don't track who is interested in your product
Forget about your personal life, your startup needs you 24/7
Keep adding fancy features and avoiding the work on the core ones
Skip writing documentation, who needs that anyway?
Don't delegate, you know everything best right?
Add a few more meetings to your calendar
Always add new tech stacks
Don't work async
