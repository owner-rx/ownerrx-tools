# X Post Formats

Proven post structures for maximum engagement on X. Each format is a reusable template — adapt it to any topic, voice, or audience.

## How to Add New Formats

1. Add a new section using `## Format: [Name]`
2. Include: What it is, Structure, Line count, Why it works, Rules
3. Keep descriptions concise — 1-2 sentences max

---

## Format: One-Liner

- **What it is:** A single powerful statement. Maximum impact in minimum words.
- **Structure:** `[Single statement — opinion, observation, or truth bomb]`
- **Line count:** 1-2 lines
- **Why it works:** Simplicity is shareable. People retweet what they can read in 2 seconds and instantly agree with.
- **Rules:** Every word must earn its place. Hit ONE idea. No filler. No explanations. If you can remove a word without losing meaning, remove it.

## Format: Two-Part Punch

- **What it is:** A setup followed by a reframe, twist, or punchline separated by a line break.
- **Structure:** `[Setup — states something expected]` + line break + `[Twist — reframes or contradicts]`
- **Line count:** 2-4 lines with a line break between parts
- **Why it works:** The gap between setup and punch creates tension. The reader's brain completes the expectation, then gets surprised by the reframe.
- **Rules:** The setup must feel complete on its own. The second part must change meaning or add unexpected depth. Never explain the twist — let it land.

## Format: Numbered List

- **What it is:** A hook headline with a number, followed by listed items and a closing punchline.
- **Structure:** `[Hook headline: "X ways to..." / "The X skills..."]` + `[Numbered items]` + `[Closing punchline]`
- **Line count:** 5-15 lines
- **Why it works:** Numbers set clear expectations. Lists are scannable. People save and bookmark lists. The closing converts passive readers into engaged ones.
- **Rules:** Use odd numbers when possible (7 > 6, 5 > 4). Each item must be specific and standalone. The closing must be actionable or opinionated — never "Hope this helps!" Variations: checklist (✓), mapped format ([Tool] solves [problem]), resource list with stats.

---

## Format: Stacked Progression

- **What it is:** A repeating grammatical pattern that builds momentum line by line toward a punchline.
- **Structure:** `[Line following pattern]` + `[Same pattern, escalating]` + `[Same pattern, escalating more]` + `[Punchline — breaks the pattern]`
- **Line count:** 4-10 lines
- **Why it works:** Rhythm creates anticipation. Each line pulls the reader forward. The pattern becomes hypnotic, making the payoff hit harder.
- **Rules:** Every line MUST follow the same grammatical structure. Build from small to big (or reverse). The punchline MUST break the pattern. Variations: timeline ("2021: X / 2022: Y"), pyramid (expanding lines), reverse pyramid (collapsing), repeated negation ("X doesn't... / Y doesn't... / Only Z does.").

## Format: Comparison (This vs That)

- **What it is:** Two contrasting approaches, mindsets, or personas shown side by side.
- **Structure:** `[Group A label + behaviors]` vs `[Group B label + behaviors]` + `[Takeaway]`
- **Line count:** 6-15 lines
- **Why it works:** People instinctively self-identify with one group. They share to signal they're in the "winning" group — or as a wake-up call to move there.
- **Rules:** Make the contrast stark. The "winning" group should be counterintuitive or surprising. Don't be preachy — let the contrast speak. Variations: timeline comparison (your startup vs competitor's), before/after ("Me in 2018 vs Me in 2025"), short two-line contrast.

---

## Format: Example + Takeaway

- **What it is:** A concept illustrated with named real-world examples, followed by an actionable lesson.
- **Structure:** `[Concept or claim]` + `[Example 1 — named company/person]` + `[Example 2]` + `[Example 3]` + `[Takeaway]`
- **Line count:** 5-12 lines
- **Why it works:** Named examples make abstract advice credible and concrete. Real companies = social proof. The takeaway converts insight into action.
- **Rules:** Use real, recognizable names (companies, founders, products). Minimum 3 examples. The takeaway must be specific — not "think about this" but "do this." Variations: mapped format ([Company] = [what their MVP was]), tool-to-problem ([Tool] solves [problem]), strategy extraction.

---

## Format: Reverse Advice

- **What it is:** A sarcastic "how-to" list that teaches the opposite of what you should do.
- **Structure:** `[Ironic headline: "How to [bad outcome] 101:"]` + `[Bad behavior 1]` + `[Bad behavior 2]` + ...
- **Line count:** 5-12 lines
- **Why it works:** Reverse psychology. People recognize their own bad habits and share as a self-aware confession or warning. The implied lesson is stronger than stating it directly.
- **Rules:** Play it straight — no winking, no "just kidding." Every item must be a real mistake people actually make. Deadpan tone. Don't add a serious lesson at the end — the sarcasm IS the lesson.

---

## Format: Humor

- **What it is:** An unexpected twist, exaggeration, or absurd observation about the industry.
- **Structure:** `[Setup — normal or relatable scenario]` + `[Punchline — unexpected twist or absurd conclusion]`
- **Line count:** 1-4 lines
- **Why it works:** Humor triggers sharing. Relatability + surprise = virality. Industry humor signals insider status, creating community.
- **Rules:** The humor must be relatable to the target audience. Deadpan delivery > trying to be funny. One joke per post. Industry-specific > generic. Don't explain the joke.
