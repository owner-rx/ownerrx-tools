## Lessons Learned

### Post #1

I run a 23-person software development agency.

Here are 5 things I would never do again:

1️⃣ Start hiring only when it's urgent

When your sales side starts popping off, it's too late to start searching for high quality engineers.

Most likely you'll end up with a bad hire.

This is why we hire when it's low season.

Be prepared.

2️⃣ Lowering the price to win the deal

While it might seem simple to just lower your price a little, it can bring more harm than good.

People and their skills grow overtime.

And after a while it's much harder to raise the price.

3️⃣ Not using automation

Automate everything that saves you time.

>Client onboarding
>Employee onboarding
>Auto sales responder
>Content distribution

You'll wish you started sooner.

4️⃣ Not firing fast enough

We've kept people in our agency for way longer than we should.

When there's no room for someone, cut them.

It might seem brutal, but at the end that revenue could have been directed into growth.

5️⃣ Not building a personal brand

Key takeaway.

If you're not building a personal brand as a founder, you are ALREADY behind.

Start posting your journey online.

## Actionable Blueprint

### Post #2

I've built and scaled SaaS MVPs to $10,000,000 ARR.

If I had a working SaaS MVP right now, this is the exact blueprint I would follow to get it to $1k MRR:

1) Start Sharing in Public

For the next 30 days, I would record myself showcasing the features I've added, or what I did to promote my SaaS and what results it brought in.

This helps build trust and recognition early on.

Post on X, LinkedIn and Instagram.

2) Email Marketing

Add an email sequence when a new customer:

- Creates an account
- Completes his first action
- Doesn't log in for 3 days
- Stays with you for 1 month

Send out emails that:

- Showcase how you use your platform
- Push the user to upgrade to a higher plan
- Get the user familiar with your most powerful feature
- Showcase the ROI you're generating for that specific user

3) Start Posting on Reddit

Block out 1 hour of your day to scroll Reddit communities where your ICP is the most active in.

Post questions or insights 2 times per week in these subreddits:

r/SaaS
r/startup
r/indiebiz
r/startups
r/MicroSaaS
r/SideProject
r/Entrepreneur
r/smallbusiness
r/growmybusiness

+ find the ones where your ICP is.

4) Product Hunt Launch

1 month before your PH launch, upvote the top 5 products and DM the founders saying you upvoted.

Ask them if they'll support your launch next month.

You'll build connections this way and a pretty good growth trajectory for your own launch day.

When the time comes, post your product on Product Hunt.

5) Give Out Lifetime Deals

When you're just starting out feedback is more important than revenue.

Give out lifetime deals to 20 people in return for a product feedback.

This will help you understand your ICP in the best possible way.

6) Send 30 DMs Daily

Connect with 30 people daily on LinkedIn and X.

Send a 1-sentence pitch about what you're building and if they'll be willing to try it out for free for 1 month.

7) Launch an Affiliate Program

Let others work for you by promoting your product.

Keep in mind that your product is new, so it's not recognizable, meaning that you'll probably have to give out 40-50% in affiliate commissions.

This can help you replace your sales agent and bring in customers while you sleep.

—

There are many more strategies that you can utilize, and I'm going to write about them, but this should be more than enough to acquire your first 50 users.

50 * $25/mo = $1,250/mo

Now this gives you a good starting point to move into SEO, ads, and influencer marketing.

Give it a try.

## Personal Story

### Post #3

Recently a potential client chose another agency to work with and it broke my heart.

I was pissed off at first.

Perfect sales pitch.

Tailor-made presentation.

Every objection handled like a freakin' wolf of wall street.

Then a follow up email came - "We really enjoyed the conversation and were impressed by the clarity and structure of your presentation."

"Nailed it", I thought.

I still knew they were speaking to 2 other agencies, so we had to bring our A game.

Radio silence followed.

Then the "Unfortunately" email came.

My heart sank.

I immediately started searching for the agency they went with.

And boy did I have something to see.

A perfect case study.

100% match with what they were trying to build.

And I said, you know what, it's fair. They deserve it.

What's crazy is that we could have done an amazing job on this software, however deep down, I can understand their decision as I make them the exact same way myself as well.

I always start by looking at previous work.

If it doesn't resonate, I have nothing else to look at.

So it was a quick reality check for me and for the team at Nortik, to get back in the lab, and focus on top 3 industries we're proficient in.

For now my picks are Marketing, Healthcare and Fintech.

On to the next one.

## Strategy Breakdown

### Post #4

This is one of the coolest strategies I've seen in a while.

Have to give credit to Tom from Marketing Ideas for this one!

Apparently, putting a blurry background of your product on your signup page,

Can lead to a 52% increase in signups on average.

MyCase saw a whopping 94%!

Why this works?

1️⃣ Curiosity trigger

↳ Users feel like they're "almost there" and are curious to see what's behind the curtain.

2️⃣ Increased trust

↳ Hints that something valuable and tangible lies underneath, it's not just a fancy landing page, but an actual product.

3️⃣ Attention focus

↳ A clear and detailed product UI might distract users from your main CTA, this fits in perfectly as your UI background.

How to make this strategy more effective?

👉 Add a video instead of an image.

Interactivity is a huge performance booster.

You're inducing FOMO that something is happening behind the signup wall.

And you just need to complete this 1 simple step to unlock it.

### Post #5

Here's a SaaS UX hack that will increase your engagement rate.

(works best in onboarding or checkouts)

I call it the "visual tangible result".

The goal is to present specific options or labels as tangible results in the real world.

Ditch the dropdowns, selects and inputs.

Replace them with groupings and sliders.

This can be a great strategy to utilize in your multistep forms.

Personally I never like it when I have to fill out a big form with a lot of inputs or dropdowns.

With this strategy you're allowing your user to use your platform faster.

Instead of 3 clicks, you're cutting down to only 1.

All while making the experience much more engaging & unique.

Tangible all the way!

## Case Study

### Post #6

Duolingo's push notifications have a 4x higher open rate than the industry average.

And they break every "best practice" in the book.

They're guilt-trippy. Passive-aggressive. Weird.

"These reminders don't seem to be working. We'll stop sending them."

That notification alone became a meme.

But here's the thing:

It works because it sounds like a person, not a product.

Most SaaS notifications read like they were written by a legal team.

"You have 3 pending tasks awaiting your attention."

Nobody talks like that.

Duolingo talks like a friend who's slightly disappointed in you.

And that emotional texture is why people screenshot their notifications and share them online for free.

Your push notifications are free marketing real estate.

However most companies waste it on robotic copy.

The next time you skip something simple like notification copy, just remember that everything reflects on your brand.

—

🎯 Does your product sound like a human or a system notification?

Be honest.

## Industry Hot Take

### Post #7

We've officially entered an era of "fast-fashion" SaaS products.

Anyone with a Lovable + Cursor subscription can now ship SaaS-es like there's no tomorrow.

Even Sam Altman talked about this.

So you know the topic is HOT right now. 🔥

Ok I'll say it: building a SaaS prototype isn't something that's considered hard anymore.

All over my timeline I'm seeing 19-yo kids go from idea to a working prototype in 48 hours.

However the question stays: How do you trust those products?

Newsflash: You don't.

You trust the founder.

Trust is now more important than ever, and your personal brand is the only way to do it.

Let's say you build & launch a SaaS.

You do everything right.

Clean codebase.

Product Hunt launch.

Landing that clearly explains the benefit.

And…crickets.

Now what about if Alex Hormozi launched the exact same thing?

See what I'm talking about?

The game has changed.

It's not about who can build it.

It's about who can distribute it.

SaaS is easier to start than ever.

But building something worth sticking around still takes taste, depth, and time.

And your biggest leverage is becoming known in your circle for a problem that's worth solving.

Or as I like to say:

Trust the founder = trust the SaaS.

## Quick Hack

### Post #8

Quick hack to optimize your pricing page.

Instead of Basic / Pro / Enterprise,

Show cards like:

👉 Personal
👉 For Startups (1-10)
👉 For Scaleups (10-50)

Why this works?

✅ Removes the guesswork around what "Pro" means.
✅ Helps you get familiar with the tier you belong to instantly.
✅ Shortens the buy-in process, resulting in increased opt-ins.

You can literally go & A/B test it right now.

Let me know the results!
