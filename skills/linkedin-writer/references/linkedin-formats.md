# LinkedIn Post Formats

Proven post structures for maximum engagement on LinkedIn. Each format is a reusable template — adapt it to any topic, voice, or audience.

LinkedIn-specific context: LinkedIn's algorithm rewards posts that generate comments and dwell time. Posts appear in feed with a "see more" fold after ~210 characters (first 2-3 lines). The hook must compel the click. Long-form posts (800-1,500 characters) consistently outperform short ones on LinkedIn.

## How to Add New Formats

1. Add a new section using `## Format: [Name]`
2. Include: What it is, Structure, Length, Why it works, When to use, Rules
3. Keep descriptions concise — 1-2 sentences max

## Format: Lessons Learned

- **What it is:** Authority credential + numbered lessons from real experience, each with context and explanation.
- **Structure:** `[Authority hook: "I [credential]. Here are X things I [learned/would never do/wish I knew]:"]` + `[Numbered items, each with 2-4 lines of context]` + `[Closing question for engagement]`
- **Length:** 800-1,500 characters
- **Why it works:** The authority hook builds credibility above the fold. Numbered items are scannable. Each expanded item delivers standalone value. The question at the end drives comments.
- **When to use:** User wants to share multiple tips, mistakes, lessons, or advice points from their experience.
- **Rules:** Lead with a specific credential (number of years, team size, revenue, etc.). Each numbered item must have context — not just a title. Use emoji numbers (1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣) for visual hierarchy. End with a question that invites the reader to share their own experience. Odd numbers preferred (5 > 4, 7 > 6).

## Format: Actionable Blueprint

- **What it is:** A comprehensive step-by-step playbook for achieving a specific measurable outcome.
- **Structure:** `[Credibility hook: "I [achievement]. Here's the exact blueprint to [outcome]:"]` + `[Numbered steps, each with tactical detail]` + `[Math/proof that shows the outcome]` + `[Encouraging closer]`
- **Length:** 1,000-2,000 characters
- **Why it works:** Specificity creates trust. Step-by-step format reduces overwhelm. The math at the end makes the outcome feel achievable and concrete. People save blueprints — high bookmark rate.
- **When to use:** User wants to share a complete process, roadmap, or playbook for achieving a specific result.
- **Rules:** Every step must be actionable — "do X" not "think about X." Include specific numbers, tools, or platforms. Add math or proof that connects the steps to the outcome. Don't end with "Hope this helps" — end with conviction or a push to action.

## Format: Personal Story

- **What it is:** A vulnerable first-person narrative with an emotional arc that leads to a business lesson.
- **Structure:** `[Hook: emotional or unexpected opening]` + `[Rising action: what happened, with tension-building short sentences]` + `[Turning point: the moment of realization]` + `[Lesson: what you learned]` + `[CTA: question that invites others to share their story]`
- **Length:** 800-1,500 characters
- **Why it works:** Vulnerability builds trust. Stories trigger empathy and emotional investment. People remember stories 22x more than facts. The shared-experience CTA at the end drives comments.
- **When to use:** User has a personal experience, failure, setback, win, or pivotal moment to share with a business lesson.
- **Rules:** Start with emotion, not context. Use short sentences for tension ("Radio silence followed." / "My heart sank."). Show the emotion through the narrative, don't just name it. The lesson must feel earned by the story, not tacked on. End with a question that invites similar stories from readers. Be specific about details — names, numbers, timelines.

## Format: Strategy Breakdown

- **What it is:** A deep dive into one specific strategy, tactic, or technique with supporting evidence and reasoning.
- **Structure:** `[Hook: surprising result or bold claim]` + `[The strategy explained clearly]` + `[Why it works — numbered reasons with ↳ explanations]` + `[How to make it better / actionable next step]`
- **Length:** 600-1,200 characters
- **Why it works:** Single-strategy focus creates depth over breadth. Data and proof build credibility. The "why it works" breakdown satisfies curiosity. The improvement tip at the end adds unexpected extra value.
- **When to use:** User wants to explain a specific technique, hack, UX pattern, or approach with evidence of why it works.
- **Rules:** Lead with a specific, surprising result or stat. Credit sources when applicable. Use numbered sub-points with arrow indicators (↳) for clean visual hierarchy. Each "why" must be a distinct reason, not a rephrasing. End with a practical next step the reader can take immediately.

## Format: Case Study

- **What it is:** Analysis of a real company or brand's specific approach, with counterintuitive insight and actionable takeaway.
- **Structure:** `[Hook: surprising stat or counterintuitive result about the company]` + `[What they do differently]` + `[Why it works — analysis]` + `[What most people/companies do wrong instead]` + `[Actionable takeaway + question for the reader]`
- **Length:** 600-1,200 characters
- **Why it works:** Real company names create instant credibility and curiosity. Counterintuitive insights challenge assumptions. The contrast with "what most do wrong" creates self-reflection. People share case studies to signal expertise.
- **When to use:** User wants to analyze a specific company, product, or brand's approach and extract lessons for their audience.
- **Rules:** Use real, named companies — never "Company X." Lead with the most surprising or counterintuitive element. Show the contrast between what the company does vs. what's considered "normal." The takeaway must be applicable to the reader's own business. End with a direct question to the reader.

## Format: Industry Hot Take

- **What it is:** A bold, opinionated stance on a current industry trend, shift, or controversial topic.
- **Structure:** `[Hook: bold declaration about an industry shift]` + `[Evidence and context that builds the argument]` + `[Rhetorical question or scenario that drives the point home]` + `[Punchline / memorable closer that encapsulates the take]`
- **Length:** 800-1,500 characters
- **Why it works:** Strong opinions polarize — and polarization drives engagement. People either agree passionately or feel compelled to debate. Specific scenarios ("what if Alex Hormozi launched the same thing?") make abstract points concrete. Memorable closers get screenshotted and shared.
- **When to use:** User wants to share a strong opinion, contrarian view, prediction, or commentary on an industry trend or shift.
- **Rules:** Take a clear side — no hedging, no "it depends." Use specific, current examples (people, tools, events). Build the argument progressively — don't just state the opinion, make the reader feel it through evidence and scenarios. The closer must be quotable — something people would screenshot. Don't attack individuals; challenge ideas, patterns, and assumptions.

## Format: Quick Hack

- **What it is:** A short, specific, immediately actionable optimization with clear reasoning.
- **Structure:** `[Hook: "Quick hack to [outcome]"]` + `[Instead of X, do Y — the change]` + `[Why it works — 2-3 bullet points with ✅ or 👉]` + `[Push to action]`
- **Length:** 300-600 characters (shortest format)
- **Why it works:** Low time investment to read = high engagement rate. Specific before/after is immediately useful. The "why" prevents it from feeling like shallow advice. The push to action creates urgency and comments.
- **When to use:** User has a small but impactful tip, optimization, or hack they want to share quickly.
- **Rules:** Start with "Quick hack" or similar immediate-value signal. Show the before (what people currently do) and the after (what to do instead). Use visual markers (✅ 👉) for clarity. Keep it under 600 characters — this is the one format where brevity wins. End with a call to test it or share results.
