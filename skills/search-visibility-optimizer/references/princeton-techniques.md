Use this reference when rewriting the user's weakest-scoring sections. Apply the TOP 3 techniques (proven 30-40% visibility boost). Avoid the ineffective techniques.

## Effective Techniques (USE THESE)

### 1. Statistics Addition (+30-40% visibility)

Replace qualitative claims with quantitative data. Every factual assertion should have a number attached.

**Before:** "Many small businesses struggle with project management."
**After:** "According to a 2025 PMI survey, 67% of businesses with under 50 employees report missing project deadlines at least quarterly."

**Rules:**
- Use specific numbers, not ranges ("43%" not "40-50%")
- Cite the source inline ("according to [source]")
- Prefer recent data (within 2 years)
- If exact data isn't available, note that the user should find/add their own data with a placeholder

### 2. Citation Addition (+30-40% visibility)

Add inline citations to authoritative sources for every factual claim.

**Before:** "AI adoption is accelerating in small businesses."
**After:** "AI adoption among SMBs grew 78% year-over-year in 2025 (McKinsey Global Survey, 2025), with customer service and marketing automation leading adoption categories."

**Rules:**
- Cite specific studies, reports, or organizations by name
- Include the year of the source
- Prefer: academic papers, industry reports (McKinsey, Gartner, Forrester), government data, named surveys
- Avoid: "a study shows", "research indicates" (these are the anti-pattern)

### 3. Quotation Addition (+30-40% visibility)

Add direct quotes from named experts, customers, or industry figures.

**Before:** "Our customers love the product."
**After:** "'Since implementing [tool], our team reduced project delivery time by 34%,' says Maria Chen, Operations Director at ScaleUp Corp."

**Rules:**
- Name the person and their title/organization
- Make quotes specific and data-rich when possible
- If rewriting for the user, use placeholder names/quotes and tell them to replace with real ones
- Real quotes > fabricated ones. Mark any placeholder quotes clearly.

## Marginally Effective Techniques

### 4. Entity Specificity

Replace generic terms with specific named entities (people, organizations, products, frameworks).

**Before:** "A leading tech company developed this approach."
**After:** "Anthropic's research team, led by Dario Amodei, developed this approach in their 2024 Constitutional AI paper."

### 5. Fluency Optimization

Improve readability. Short sentences. Active voice. One idea per paragraph.

## Ineffective Techniques (AVOID THESE)

### 6. Keyword Stuffing (-10% visibility)

The Princeton study found this HURTS. Do not increase keyword density beyond natural usage. AI engines penalize obvious keyword repetition.

### 7. Authoritative Tone Alone

Simply making text sound more confident ("We definitively state...") without backing claims with data does NOT improve AI visibility. Confidence without evidence is penalized.

### 8. Generic Persuasive Writing

Marketing language ("best-in-class", "industry-leading", "cutting-edge") actively hurts AI citation probability. Replace with specific, verifiable claims.

## Rewriting Process

When rewriting a section:

1. Identify what's weak (no stats? no citations? vague claims?)
2. Apply the TOP 3 techniques to fix it
3. Show the original and rewritten version side-by-side
4. Explain what changed and why (educates the business owner)
5. Mark any placeholder data/quotes that the owner needs to replace with real information
6. Preserve the owner's voice and tone — optimize the substance, not the style
